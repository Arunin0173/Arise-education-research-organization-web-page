                <h1 class="txt1">What is Education !</h1>
                <p class="txt2">Education is the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and habits through
                    teaching, training, or research. It can take place in formal settings, such as schools and
                    universities, or through informal experiences, such as self-learning or real-life observations.
                    Education not only equips individuals with the information they need to navigate their daily lives
                    but also helps develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. It fosters
                    personal growth, encourages intellectual curiosity, and promotes a deeper understanding of the world
                    around us.</p>
